								<h2>History of Druzhina Putivl</h2>
								<p>The Washington, D.C. scout group was founded on <strong>March 1, 1965</strong> by Scout Instructor Lydia Petrovna Gerich. It was initially known as Admiral Nakhimov Joint Troop 4.</p>
								<p>In January 1970, Scoutmaster Michael A. Danilevsky came to Washington. Scouting activities picked up the pace and by the summer of 1971 the group had organized its first separate summer camp.</p>
								<p>The ranks of Washington, D.C. Russian scouts grew in number year after year. In 1977, after 12 years, the troop grew into a full-fledged <i>druzhina</i> (chapter) of about 50 people under the leadership of SM Michael Danilevsky. The Druzhina takes its name from the ancient Russian town of Putivl, mentioned in the famous Tale of Igor's Campaign. The names of the boy and girl scout troops were chosen in honor of Prince Igor and Princess Yaroslavna, who visited Putivl in the epic tale.</p>

								<h3>Druzhina Putivl‚Äôs contribution to restoring scouting in Russia</h3>
								<p>In 1989, a congress of St. George Pathfinders leaders resolved to finally realize our organization's mission of returning scouting to Russia. In August 1990, a delegation from Druzhina Putivl led by Scoutmaster M. I. Levitskaya visited Russia and actively participated in the first ORUR Russian scout camp, held near the village of Gorelets, Kostroma Region. Earlier, in June 1989, a group of Druzhina Tsarskoye Selo (New York Chapter) members held a bonfire and scouting activities in Pavlovsky Park, the cradle of the Russian scouting movement in 1909. In subsequent years, our Washingtonians made increasingly frequent trips to Russia ‚Äì among them was Senior Scoutmaster M. A. Danilevsky, who headed all of SGPA from 1986 to 2009. Scout leaders made individual trips to Russia over the years, sharing their scouting experience and helping with tasks.</p>

								<p>In 1991, our Washington, D.C. scouts - Alexey, Andrey and Vera Zarechnyak, together with Dimitry Ekzarkhov, provided significant assistance in holding a camp for the chapter of Russian scouts in St. Petersburg.</p>

								<p>In 1994, at an anniversary jamboree in Anapa, Druzhina Putivl was represented by a delegation led by chapter head Nikita Zelensky. SM Lydia Gerich writes - <blockquote>In 1994 I went to the first jamboree in Anapa. It left an unforgettable impression: the Black Sea, scouts in formation, Russian and scout flags waving, tears in our eyes: ‚ÄúNow we are back‚Äù... Everything was like in a dream. Scout leaders from Russia stood nearby, whispering: ‚Äúthank you for preserving and returning scouting to us.‚Äù</strong> The friendship, the understanding! Yes, <b>indeed, ‚Äúwe are all sisters, we are all brothers.‚Äù</b></blockquote></p>

								<p>In the summer of 1999, at a jamboree marking the 90th anniversary of Russian scouting, held near the city of Pavlovsk, our Washington group was represented by a delegation led by instructor M. I. Levitskaya.</p>
